Restaurants Reviews
In this project I have used Natural language Processing to classify the reviews given by customers for a restaurant.Here I have used Naive Bayes algorithm to classify the reviews into positive and negative.

Libraries Required pandas,re,nltk, sklearn

Below are the steps used in this model:
Data Cleaning
Our raw data is in text format ,we need to remove stop words from it and convert string into list.To do this we have used re and nltk library.
Bag of Word model
To create the bag of word model , we have used sklearn's feature extraction CountVectorizer class.
Build the model using Naive Bayes
